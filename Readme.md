A project to create an elastic search index of selected files from the IMDB movie database

Currently uses the running-times, genres, plot, keywords,release-dates. More data might be added in future. 

Data is provided as custom text files made available by IMDB. Note that I removed the preamble from these files. 

Written in Java to experiment with the elastic search Java API
