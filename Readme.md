A project to create an elastic search index of selected files from the IMDB movie database

Currently uses the running-times, genres, plot, keywords, writers, release-dates, actors and actresses. More data might be added in future. 

Data is provided as custom text files made available by IMDB. 

Written in Java to experiment with the elastic search Java API
